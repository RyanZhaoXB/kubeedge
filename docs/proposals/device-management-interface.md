## KubeEdge Device Management Interface (DMI)

### Goal

This proposal provides the Device Management Interface(i.e. DMI) which integrates the device management interface and optimizes the device management capability of KubeEdge. It is the goal of KubeEdge DMI that builds a cloud native device twin management platform which covers device management, device operation and device data. 

Cloud Native: DMI makes device a virtualized digital twin as a resource of Kubernetes

Device Management: DMI helps users to manage device lifecycle like pod with simplifies operations

Device Operation: DMI provides the ability of device operation through Kubernetes API and  local command API by users and deployment

Device Data: DMI provides the ability that the data can be consumed by local deployment and migrated to cloud in special cases

### User Story by Scenario

#### 1. camera video at parking

1. the data application obtains the address of the camera video stream by device ID
2. the data application can subscribe to the changes of the camera address
3. the data application can analyse the video stream locally and upload the processing results, such as charging, emergency and facial recognition, to the cloud
4. the origin video can be uploaded to the cloud for model training iteration
5. the local application can recognize the license plate number and make the lever lifted automatically
6. video streams can be cached locally for backtracking

#### 2. photo by industrial camera

1. the data application subscribes to the data provided by industrial cameras
2. the photos taken by industrial cameras can be stored locally
3. the photos of the industrial camera can be preview and the angle and the definition can be adjusted
4. the policy of automatic photo shooting of the camera can be configured 
5. the industrial camera can be controlled to take photos manually
6. the data application can process the photos and upload the results to cloud or the 3rd-party application
7. the local application can handle the local device, such as industrial computer and alarm device, according to the processing results

#### 3. structured data, such as current and voltage, collected by sensors

1. the data application subscribes to the real-time data of current and voltage
2. the real-time data of current and voltage can be stored locally
3. the data application can analyse the historical data for predictive maintenance

### Scheme

##### Architecture

![dmi-architecture](../images/dmi/dmi-architecture.bmp)

1. Edge applications access device data through the REST service.
2. Cloud applications access device data through REST Service.
3. The mapper pushes data to edge applications by configuring the REST destination address.
4. Mapper pushes data to cloud applications by configuring the REST destination address.
5. The mapper pushes data to the edge database by configuring the destination address.
6. The mapper pushes data to the MQTT broker by configuring the destination address.
7. The edge application subscribes to device data through the MQTT broker topic.
8. The cloud application subscribes to device data through the MQTT broker topic.
9. The edge application processes the data and uploads the processing result to the cloud.

##### Component Function

* Device Manager: component for management of device information and data. It can synchronize device twin information to Kubernetes with upstream through edgehub and downstream through DMI. The DMI will be implemented by DMI mapper. 

* Device Mapper: core component for KubeEdge to interconnect devices. It is a logical component and can have multiple forms. For example, it can be a complete binary application deployed on edge nodes or consist of multiple independent binary applications which are independent  existing binary applications in the ecosystem. It can also be an open source product, possibly a third-party device management platform cooperating with DMI shim. If the device manager connects to the device mapper through MQTT, the related interfaces must be consistent with those of the existing KubeEdge  mapper. The device manager can be forward compatible with the mapper of earlier versions. If the device mapper is connected in REST mode, you can use grpc to implement the connection. The device mapper consists of multiple submodules, which are described as follows:
  * DeviceMapper: protocol interface conversion component, which is used to process interfaces for device management. It is also can be implemented by third-party systems.
  * Data collection: A device data collection component that implements data management-related interfaces and can be integrated into Device Mapper. It is also can be implemented by third-party systems.
  * DeviceTwin: A device data management component that implements data management interfaces, formats data based on the delivered data template, connects to the device data collection component, and provides data-related services for data consumers in the form of services or mqtt topic. It is also can be implemented by third-party systems.
  * Destination Rule: data rule engine component, which is used to configure the destination address of data pushed by the Mapper.
  * DMI shim: platform-specific protocol interface conversion component.

### Designing of DMI CRD 

The current CRD definitions of Device and DeviceModel cannot meet the new resource attribute requirements of DMI. To meet the new requirements and be compatible with the original definitions, the CRD definitions of Device and DeviceModel are as follows.

The CRD design related to the DMI is as follows.
